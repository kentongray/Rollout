##
A mobile (ionic/cordova) and web (angular-material) app built using for tracking pickup schedules in the City of Houston.

Winner of the [Houston Hackathon](http://houstonhackathon.com). Rep Houston tech scene and participate next year!
##Getting Started
1. Run `npm install`.
2. Run `npm install -g ionic`. If you had installed ionic previously uninstall it first(`npm uninstall -g ionic`).
3. If running on device you will want to install the cordova plugins, `ionic state restore`.

Normal ionic commands apply (e.g. `ionic serve` `ionic run ios`)

Desktop support still in the works for the new version
--To run the desktop
--Run `gulp && gulp serve`
--`gulp watch` is available to auto reload.

Hit me up with questions and! Would love to have some volunteers.


##Desktop
Desktop version is totally broken right now. Probably will be creating a seperate repo for that soon

##Server
[Rollout Server](https://github.com/kentongray/rollout-server) handles the scheduling portion. 


##Props
**Victor Ramos [@victorcoding](https://github.com/victorcoding)** provided localization for Spanish and general updates ðŸŽ‰

##Ideas/Projects
* ~more info on each "category" IE if you hit tree waste give a good explanation as to what that is~
* Interested in adding more data if anyone has any good data sources.
* #crazyidea nation-wide database of pickup regions with tooling to allow cities and citizens to manage it
* ~Drop off locations~
